# Get GitHub release information 

Allows you to get a release information by release id, tag, commit SHA or get the last release.

If release not found, it finishes with an error.

## Inputs

### Search by:

Set **exactly 1 input** from the list to search release by:

#### ðŸ”¸ `releaseId` 
Release id (number).

#### ðŸ”¸ `tag` 
Tag name.

#### ðŸ”¸ `commitSha`
SHA of commit. Can be used to find a draft release.

#### ðŸ”¸ `releaseName`
Exact release name. Returns most recent found. Can be used to find a draft release.

#### ðŸ”¸ `releaseNameRegEx` 
Regexp to test release name

#### ðŸ”¸ `latest` 
Set `1` or `true` to get the latest non-draft release.

_If no inputs specified, the action will try to get release for the current commit SHA._

### Additional filters

With any of inputs above you can also use 2 additional filter inputs:

#### ðŸ”¹ `draft`
Set `true` to search only for draft releases. <br>
Set `false` to search only releases that are not draft.
Leave empty to not check if a release is a draft.

#### ðŸ”¹ `prerelease`
Set `true` to search only for prerelease releases.<br>
Set `false` to search only releases that are not prerelease.
Leave empty to not check if a release is a prerelease.

### Options

#### ðŸ”» `doNotFailIfNotFound` _Optional, default: `false`_

Set `true` to force the action to finish with success even if release was not found. 
Can be useful in composite actions, where `continue-on-error` is not available.
If set, you can examine `id` output to know if release was found.

#### ðŸ”» `searchLimit` _Optional, default: `90`_
If you use one of `commitSha`, `releaseName`, 
`releaseNameRegEx` inputs you can also specify how many releases action should retrieve to perform 
a search. Specify more than 90 if
you age going to search for old releases and less if you want to speed up the search.

#### ðŸ”» `repo` _Optional, default: current repository_

Repository name in form of "owner/name". If not set, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` env variable is used that by 
default points to a current repository.

## Env variables

You should set `GITHUB_TOKEN` env variable to enable action to access GitHub API. 
For some operations default `github.token` is not enough, you need to pass a personal access token.

## Outputs

* `html_url`
* `upload_url` can be used to upload assets
* `tarball_url`
* `zipball_url`
* `id`
